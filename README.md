# Travel-Insurance-Case-Study
Data Analyst Certification - Datacamp - Project for the Professional Data Analyst Certificate.

This repository contains my approach and presentation of the Case Study for the Professional Data Analyst Certification by Datacamp.
The Case Study refers to a Travel Insurance company that has decided to change their marketing strategy as a result of Covid-19 to increase their engagement with travellers. A dataset with customers as well as people who got quotes but never bought the insurance was provided to analyse their differences in travel habits between customers and non-customers.

I was given 24 hours to prepare an eight-slide presentation to the CEO (non-technical), which I then presented for 10 minutes with the support of the slides.
The repository contains the original data as well as the Python notebook that I used to manipulate and analyse the data with the final presentation in a PDF format.
